# Buisness Case
 Plagiarism in scientific writing has been a difficult problem to solve, with many scientific journals publishing articles from “paper mills” that were not written by their supposed authors. For example, “International Publisher Limited” is a Russian paper mill company that offers authorship on soon to be released scientific papers [for up to $5000](https://www.science.org/content/article/russian-website-peddles-authorships-linked-reputable-journals). While these operations often target less reputable journals, even reputable publishing houses such as Elsevier have published articles from these mills. Natural language processing as a machine learning technique has progressed greatly over the past few years, and may offer a potential solution. By developing a model that can read a paper’s text and determine likely authorship, this kind of academic fraud could be caught more easily.
